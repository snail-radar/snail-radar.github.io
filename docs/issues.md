# Known Issues

We have identified several issues in the dataset.

- To save storage space, the resolution of the ZED2i stereo images has been reduced to 640Ã—360 in resolution since Dec 8 2023.
- In some sequences, the ZED2i images and IMU data have lower rates than the nominal values, likely due to low power voltage.
