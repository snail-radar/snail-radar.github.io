# Data Collection Protocal

Our aim is to fully evaluate the newly advented 4D radars along several lines,
including point association, platform motion tracking, sparse area mapping and place recognition.

We designed a handheld rig, firstly collected data by walking around the campus,
then mounted the rig on an e-bike for better coverage and speed,
and finally mounted it on an SUV for a wider range of scenarios, e.g., highways and tunnels.

During the campaign, we favor data collection in bad weather conditions, e.g., heavy rain and night,
hoping this would show the advantages of 4D radars over other sensors.
